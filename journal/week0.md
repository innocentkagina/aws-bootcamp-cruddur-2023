### Install and Verify AWS CLI 

I was able to successfully use Gitpod and its features to install AWS CLI.

I followed  instructions on the [AWS CLI Install Documentation Page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)

I also managed to set up variables in Gitpod to have avoid exporting AWS variables everytime the Workspace is loaded. ![Image of Gitpod Variables(gp-aws-variables.png) 

I attempted to run the command by typing in `aws` but I recieved an error

```
gitpod /workspace/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/journal (main) $ aws
'aws' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
```
I was able to resolve the error by closing command prompt, and opening it again.

I created a Budget for $100 using AWS_CLI based a budget-json file as well as notifications file to send alerts incase certain thresholds are exceeded using following code
```
aws budgets create-budget \
    --account-id $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID \
    --budget file://aws/json/budget.json \
    --notifications-with-subscribers file://aws/json/notifications-with-subscribers.json

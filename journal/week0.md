### Install and Verify AWS CLI 

I was able to successfully use Gitpod and its features to install AWS CLI.

I followed  instructions on the [AWS CLI Install Documentation Page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)

I also managed to set up variables in Gitpod to have avoid exporting AWS variables everytime the Workspace is loaded. ![Image of Gitpod Variables(gp-aws-variables.png) 

I attempted to run the command by typing in `aws` but I recieved an error

```
bash: aws: command not found.
```
I was able to resolve the error by closing command prompt, and opening it again.
